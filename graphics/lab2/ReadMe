The Raytracer has been compiled and tested in stdsun.

To compile the program, run:

make

To clear the object files and the executable, run:

make clean

To run the raytracer run:

./rt <input-file.iv> <output-file.ppm> <xresolution> <yresolution> <shadow_on> <reflection_on>


Example:

./rt Data/sphere1.iv sphere1.ppm 512 512 0 0
Will generate the output to sphere1.ppm with both shadows and reflection turned off.

./rt Data/sphere1.iv sphere1.ppm 512 512 0 1
Will generate the output to sphere1.ppm with shadows turn off and reflection turned on.
