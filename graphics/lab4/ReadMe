The Raytracer has been compiled and tested in stdsun. Images generated as illustrated in the below examples are contained in the "images" directory.

To compile the program, run:

make

To clear the object files and the executable, run:

make clean

To run the raytracer, run:

./rt <input-file.iv> <output-file.ppm> <xresolution> <yresolution> <pixel-super-sampling-on> <shadow_on> <reflection_on> <refraction-on> <depth-offield-on/focal-length> <shapes-file>

To run the scene file I have created, run:
./rt Data/scene.iv out.ppm 512 512 0 1 1 1 0 shapesexample

The shapes file contains the name of the shape and texture of the shape corresponding to the object in the scene file (iv file)

In the example provided: (filename  - shapesexample)
sphere 0 -> The transformed sphere in the center with solid color / no texture
cone 5 -> Cone with Perlin Noise (Part of the lamp)
cube 1 -> The table with strips to emulate wood
cube 2 -> The cube on left side of the table with a checkerboard pattern
sphere 0 -> The sphere that is the bulb inside the lamp (no texture)
sphere 3 -> The sphere with smooth colors, on the table
cylinder 5 -> Cylinder with Perlin noise (Part of the lamp)
cube 0 -> Cube with a solid color that emulates the wire holding the lamp up
