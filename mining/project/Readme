Assignment - 1 : Generation of feature-vectors
==============================================

Note: The program has been tested on STDSUN for the "config" file included. The "config" included uses only the first 10 files of the dataset. The program aborts when all the files are included. 

Benchmark:
The program runs on my laptop in 110 seconds for the entire dataset (22 files).
On STDSUN

To compile run:
$ make

To run the algorithm run:
$ ./mine

To delete compiled files and results run:
$ make clean

Results can be found in the "results" folder
Data set can be found in the "dataset" directory
Config file can be found in the current directory (filename : "config")

The config file can be used to alter the behaviour of the algorithm and generation of feature-vectors.

Important flags and variables to consider in config file:
 - num-files
 - stem-words
 - threshold-min
 - threshold-max
 - gen-*

config file details:
====================

num-files 22  		Number of files from the dataset to use. Cannot be more than 22.
include-date no  	Include the contents of the <DATE> element for feature-vector generation 
include-topics yes  	Include the contents of the <TOPICS> element for feature-vector generation
include-places yes  	Include the contents of the <PLACES> element for feature-vector generation
include-people no  	Include the contents of the <PEOPLE> element for feature-vector generation
include-orgs no  	Include the contents of the <ORGS> element for feature-vector generation
include-exhanges no  	Include the contents of the <EXCHANGES> element for feature-vector generation
include-companies yes   Include the contents of the <COMPANIES> element for feature-vector generation
include-title yes  	Include the contents of the <TITLE> element for feature-vector generation
include-dateline no  	Include the contents of the <DATELINE> element for feature-vector generation
include-body yes  	Include the contents of the <BODY> element for feature-vector generation
stop-words yes  	Eliminate stop words *(Not used)
stem-words yes  	Apply word stemming
limit-dimension no  	Flag to limit size of the dimension *(Not used)
dimension-size 1000  	Size of the dimension *(Not used)
threshold-min 10  	Set minimum threshold frequency
threshold-max 2000  	Set maximum threshold frequency
gen-fv-set yes  	Flag to generate feature-vector of words
gen-fv-title yes  	Flag to generate titular words feature-vector
gen-fv-count no  	Flag to generate feature-vector of word-frequencies *Not recommended. Takes a long time and generates a very large file.
gen-fv-count-sparse yes Flag to generate feature-vector of word-indexes + word frequencies (This is the sparse representation of the above feature-vector)
gen-fd-with-strings no  Flag to control whether the "word" should be printed in the frequency distribution file
gen-fd-file no   	Flag to generate the frequency distribution of words ()
gen-fd-unique-file yes  Flag to generate the frequency distribution of unique words (i.e unique word occurences in articles)
gen-wf-file no  	Flag to generate the word frequencies (i.e unique word occurences in articles)
gen-wf-unique-file yes	Flag to generate the unique word frequencies 
gen-dimension-file yes	Flag to generate the dimensions (i.e the word and the word-index. This index is used in the sparse representation on the frequency feature vector.)
