=====================================================

This program has been compiled and tested on STDLOGIN. 

To compile the program:
$ make

To run the program:

$ ./neural-network <alpha> <bias> <initial-weight> <number-of-iterations>
  <alpha>             - Learning Rate
  <bias>              - Value for weight w0
  <initial-weight>    - Initial value for all the other weights
  <num-of-iterations> - Maximum number of iterations that the program should run incase the weights do not converge.

Example: ./neural-network 0.001 0 0 100000
            Here: Alpha = 0.001
                  Bias = 0
                  Initial Weight = 0
                  Number of iterations = 100000
