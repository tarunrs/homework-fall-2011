To compile the code:

Problem 1:

> g++ problem1.c
> ./a.out

Problem 2:

> g++ problem2.c
> ./a.out

The code runs for 100 iterations to allow for enough exploration. After this condition it runs till number of changes reduces to zero compared to the previous time. This gives a convergance to 3 decimal places.
